# Introduction
We want to create harmonious experiences for our users. We solve challenging interactions at the outset, and then apply the solutions consistently across our product suite - making sure people only have to learn them once.

Our guidelines have space for flexibility, and are continuously revised and expanded to suit changing product needs.

# Getting the right tools
- **Sketch App**  *(Our main tool for low and high fidelity design)*
- **Abstract**  *(Versioning and collaboration tools)*
- **Zeplin**  *(Our Design Handoff tools)*
- **Invision**  *(Click through prototype, it can be used for low as well as high fidelity stage)*
- **Jira**  *(Issue tracking and agile project management for Designers, PMs, Engineers, and Stakeholders)*
- **Trello**  *(Kanban Board app that we use for Design System related works only)*
- **Slack**  *(Our main messaging platform)*
