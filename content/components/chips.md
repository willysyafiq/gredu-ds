Chips are compact elements that represent an input, choice, or attribute.

## Input chips test Update

Input chips represent a complex piece of information in compact form, such as an entity (person, place, or thing) or text. They enable user input and verify that input by converting text into chips.

## Choice Chips

Choice chips allow selection of a single chip from a set of options. Choice chips clearly delineate and display options in a compact area. They are a good alternative to toggle buttons, radio buttons, and single select menus.

## Attribute Chips

Attribute chips act like a badge, emphasize a label or category within a card or listing scenario. For this type we use grey chips and blue chips for general badge/attribute. We use green, orange, red, and blue for status based attribute such as approval scenario.
