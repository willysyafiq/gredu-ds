## Radio Buttons
Radio buttons allow the user to select one option from a set. Use radio buttons when the user needs to see all available options. If available options can be collapsed, consider using a dropdown menu because it uses less space.

## Checkboxes
Checkboxes allow the user to select one or more items from a set. Checkboxes can be used to turn an option on or off.
