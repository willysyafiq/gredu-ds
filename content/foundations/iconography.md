## Principles
- Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, expressing essential characteristics.
- Ensure readability and clarity, even at small sizes.

## Category

Icon divided into 3 categories which are <strong>System Icon</strong>, <strong>Applet Icon</strong>, and <strong>Accent Icon</strong>. The following list are general things to pay attention to whenever working with Icons.

- Make sure icons are optically well aligned and proportional while following the specs.
- Use “Transparent” layer and rename as “Bound”.
- Make sure your Icon layer is on the top of everything for easier override purpose.
- Icon naming must be predictable, independent, and close to its physical name in the real world. 
System Icon

System Icon used for main interaction such as back, upload, delete, etc. For this category, use simple form and use single color. When needed you can use two tone for variation or adding dimension to special needs such as Microsoft Word icon, Notification icon with number bubble, etc.
